# Polynomial-regression Model
The Polynomial Regression Model is a command‑line Python program that demonstrates how to fit a polynomial regression model to data.

It:
Shows how a polynomial model can fit non‑linear data
Uses scikit‑learn’s PolynomialFeatures and LinearRegression
Provides accuracy metrics
Enables making new predictions based on user input
Ideal for beginners learning about regression, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Features
✅ Load sample data (built‑in or custom)
✅ Train Polynomial Regression Model
✅ Evaluate Model (R² Score)
✅ Predict New Values

## Technologies Used
Python 3
scikit‑learn (for polynomial regression & metrics)
numpy (for calculations)
matplotlib (optional for plotting)

## Usage
The program will:
Load the dataset (you can replace with your own).
Train the Polynomial Regression Model.
Output the R² Score.
Ask for a value to predict.
Output the predicted result.
